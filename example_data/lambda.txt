let x = a == 1 ? b : c

x
is b if a == 1
else is c

try {

} catch (e) {
 console.log(e)
}

that's JS
in Python we do

a is already known bool, separate from a_condi
get_x = lambda a_condi : b if a_condi == 1 else c
x = get_x(a)

try :
  ...
except (Exception e) :
  print(e)




ui ==> minimal and simple, use modes for each type of visuals (non-programmer users)
   each url has each algorithm predefined (update each month)

---> urls are addable : each sub-mode must have picture example

---> evaluate by excel results (table in website display first at bottom of website)
