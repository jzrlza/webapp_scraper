States storage uses 3 dict objects to fetch by indices easily
(These are accessed using 'column id + id offset' value)
-Rowspan num states
-Cell values states according to previous rowspans
-Boolean states to tell to fetch from previous rowspans or not

"To do with states and values" meanings :

Lock On => "Rowspan num states" value of previous was = 1, actions :
1. update "Rowspan num states" of given 'column id + id offset' index
2. update "Cell values states" of given 'column id + id offset' index
3. Insert value into row data
 3.1 If "Boolean states" of old un-updated 'column id + id offset' index is True, then insert the previous value
   3.1.1 If that value of "rowspan num" by same index above is 1, set "boolean state" to false to prevent next row record this one
 3.2 Else, insert new value
4. set "Boolean states", if rowspan > 1, True, else False
5. Break the while loop

Offsetting => "Rowspan num states" value of previous was > 1, actions :
1. Insert value into row data using index of 'column id + id offset' rather than just 'column id'
2. deduct "Rowspan num states" of old un-updated 'column id + id offset' index by 1
3. Check offset until 3.1 condition is False
 3.1 If 'column id + id offset' is < max columns minus 1, then add 'id offset' by 1
 3.2 Else, break the while loop
